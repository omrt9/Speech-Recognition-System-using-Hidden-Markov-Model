# Speech-Recognition-System-using-Hidden-Markov-Model
Speech Recognition System trains one Hidden Markov Model for each word that it should be able to recognize. The models are trained with labeled training data, and the classification is performed by passing the features to each model and then selecting the best match using Hidden Markov Model and algorithms associated with Probabilistic Modelling like Baum-Welch Algorithm which makes use of Forward Algorithm, Backward Algorithm and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model.
